This is the first project for the Piscine at 42.
It consists on learning the uses of shell commands.
In exercises 01 and 02, before saving the TAR file, the tasks were to change the permissions of the files using "chmod",
create hard and symbolic links, and change the timestamp of the files using the command ls.
